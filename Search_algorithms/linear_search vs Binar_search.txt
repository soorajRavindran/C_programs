Important Differences

1. Input data needs to be sorted in Binary Search and not in Linear Search
2. Linear search does the sequential access whereas Binary search access data randomly.
3. Time complexity of linear search -O(n) , Binary search has time complexity O(log n).
4. Linear search performs equality comparisons and Binary search performs ordering comparisons
